# EXP-3-Adder-sub
## Design and Verification of Half Adder and Half Subtractor
### Aim
To design and verify basic one-bit arithmetic circuits using Verilog HDL.
### Theory / Synopsis
A Half Adder adds two single-bit binary numbers, A and B, and produces a Sum and a Carry output. A Half Subtractor subtracts one single-bit binary number B from another A, producing a Difference and a Borrow output. Both circuits are purely combinational and form the basic building blocks of larger arithmetic units such as Full Adders and Full Subtractors.
Boolean Functions
Half Adder:
•	Sum = A ⊕ B
•	Carry = A . B
Half Subtractor:
•	Difference = A ⊕ B
•	Borrow = A' . B

### Simulation Procedure

STEP 1 – Open Terminal
Open a terminal in the experiment folder.

STEP 2 – Load Synopsys Environment
source /synopsys/start.sh

STEP 3 – Compile Using VCS
vcs half_add_sub.v half_add_sub_tb.v -full64
If compilation is successful, VCS generates the simulation executable:
simv

STEP 4 – Run Simulation
./simv
The terminal displays the input combinations and corresponding outputs Sum, Carry, Diff, and Borrow.
A VCD waveform file is also generated:
half_add_sub.vcd

STEP 5 – Open DVE
dve -full64
Other option
dve -full64 &
A DVE environment will open.

DVE Waveform Verification
In DVE:
•	Open the testbench hierarchy.
•	Locate the signals:
o	A
o	B
o	Sum
o	Carry
o	Diff
o	Borrow
•	Add the signals to the waveform window.
•	Run/inspect the waveform.

•	Verify that Sum = 1 whenever A and B are different (A⊕B), and Carry = 1 only when A=1 AND B=1.

•	Verify that Diff = 1 whenever A and B are different (same XOR pattern as Sum), and Borrow = 1 only when A=0 AND B=1.

•	Confirm that Carry and Borrow never both go high for the same input pair, since they represent different (AND vs A'B) conditions.

The waveform should agree with the truth table.

### Expected Result

The Half Adder and Half Subtractor were realized using Verilog HDL:

•	Sum = A⊕B, Carry = A.B
•	Diff = A⊕B, Borrow = A'.B

The design was compiled and simulated using Synopsys VCS, and the functionality was verified using DVE waveform analysis, matching the expected truth table.

### Output


### Viva-Voce Questions

•	What is a Half Adder, and what are its limitations compared to a Full Adder?

•	What is a Half Subtractor, and what does the Borrow output signify?

•	Why is the Sum/Difference expression identical (A⊕B) for both circuits, while Carry and Borrow differ?

•	What gate realizes the XOR function, and why is it central to both circuits?

•	What is the purpose of a Verilog testbench?

•	Why is a VCD file generated, and what does $dumpvars(0, tb) do?

•	What is the purpose of ./simv?

•	What is the difference between simulation and synthesis?

•	How would you extend this design to a Full Adder/Full Subtractor?

### Result

Thus, the Half Adder and Half Subtractor were designed, implemented using Verilog HDL, successfully simulated using Synopsys VCS, and verified using Synopsys DVE.
